# The Court-Side Effect: Exploring the Relationship Between NBA Team Performance and Game Attendance

## 📖 Project Overview
This project, developed for **COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice)**, investigates whether an NBA team's performance influences game attendance. \
Specifically, we analyzed data spanning from the 2001 to 2023 NBA seasons to uncover trends and relationships between team wins, Elo ratings, and attendance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Analyze the relationship between team performance (measured by wins and Elo ratings) and game attendance.
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Understand the impact of home-court advantage and team consistency on attendance.
  - Assess trends in attendance over time and anomalies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic's effect.

## 🛠️ Features
- Data collection and cleaning for NBA attendance and performance metrics.
- Utilized **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression** to identify the key predictors of game attendance.
- Visualization of trends using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Analysis of anomalies, such as attendance drops during COVID-19 pandemic.
