    "During an NBA game, each team sends five players to battle it out on the court, showcasing their skills and strategy to determine who’s better. But what about the invisible sixth man in the arena: the fans? Beyond the players and coaches, does the energy and sheer presence of fans affect a team’s performance? And in turn, does a team’s success on the court bring more fans into the stands? We will set out to cover this symbiotic relationship between team performance and attendance numbers by aiming to answer the question of if an NBA team’s performance will influence the number of attendants during the 2001-2024 seasons. We have found this to be an interesting topic as fans of the NBA since it would be insightful to see if there is correlation between how good a team is and how many fans there are to witness the games in person. Outside of our own love for the game, we figure that this research project will help answer other questions regarding the NBA such as if home court advantage matters, how a team’s players and marketability of those players affect attendance, and how a team’s attendance numbers can fluctuate over time due to how a team is performing. \n",

    "In a previous study conducted by Chenzao Wang in 2024 called “The Effect of NBA Attendance on Team’s Performance”<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), they covered the impact of attendance on team performance during the 2020-2021 NBA season in comparison to regular NBA seasons. The 2020-2021 was the season that got hit by COVID-19 complications in the middle of the playoffs, moving 22 NBA teams to closed arenas in Orlando, Florida, dubbed the “Bubble” era of the NBA. During this time audiences were very limited (only consisting of close friends, family, and staff), and there wasn’t really a home-court advantage as every team played in the same arena in Orlando (there was only one team that could have potentially benefited from “home court advantage”, the Orlando Magic). Wang took the stats of all 30 NBA teams from 2015-2022 (Field Goal Percentage, Free Throws Made, etc.) and the attendance numbers of the 2020-2021 “Bubble” season and analyzed them to see if there was a difference in team performance when there were fans in attendance and little to no fans in attendance. The study concluded in finding there was a slight advantage to home teams when they had audiences present (normal NBA seasons), and home court advantage was less obvious when there were no audiences (COVID season). This finding supports the theory that NBA team performance is positively affected by the fans in attendance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The influence of star players on NBA attendance has also been well-documented as Metcalfe (2013)<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) explored the impact of \"star power\" on fan attendance in his paper \"NBA Star Power: Impact on Attendance.\" This study examined how having highly skilled or well-known players on a team affects fan turnout, analyzing data over several seasons. Metcalfe’s findings suggested that star players are a significant driver of attendance, as fans are more likely to attend games featuring popular or top-performing athletes. This concept of \"star power\" extends beyond wins and losses, suggesting that fans often view games as an opportunity to see high-profile athletes perform, regardless of the team’s overall record. By examining this factor, Metcalfe’s study sheds light on how audience patterns might align with elements outside of win-loss records, offering a framework for our research as we investigate how team success (wins across both home and away games) relates to attendance across a longer timeline. This background suggests that while an increase in wins might boost attendance, accounting for star presence and team market size will be crucial in creating an accurate model for our research question, which examines 2001-2024 data to assess the broader relationship between team performance and fan engagement.\n",

    "We hypothesize that an NBA team’s performance is positively correlated with game attendance. We predict that the teams with better performance metrics will see a higher average attendance. The performance metrics we will base on are higher number of wins and improved Elo ratings. \n",
    "We also anticipate that this correlation may vary depending on whether the game was at home or away, where there is a stronger correlation for home games due to the support of the local fan base. Also, we take into account some other confounding variables, such as team funding as well as city population. We predict a stronger correlation for the teams with higher budgets or located in densely populated cities. \n",
    "Our main prediction is that team performance and attendance have a positive relationship, with attendance likely increasing as team performance improves throughout the season."
